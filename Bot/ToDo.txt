TODO:

PathFinder : ensure pathing to a building doesn't break *because the tiles the building sits on are not walkable*

Builder : build buildings in normal places (don't use BuildOnLocation)

Paths : create walkable paths between every base

Paths : create flyable paths between every base

Buildingplacer : improve the CanBuild check

Fix bug where base locations are put in the wrong location
